## Features

- Dynamic 3D city generation with procedural building placement
- Animated point-cloud building representations
- Neural network visualization with dynamic connections
- Particle flow system simulating cyber traffic
- Street grid with ambient lighting effects
- Post-processing effects (bloom, noise, vignette)
- Interactive camera controls

## Technologies

- React
- Three.js
- React Three Fiber
- React Three Drei
- Post Processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openseb/ccv.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
cd ccv
npm install
```
3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

## Usage

- Use mouse/trackpad to orbit around the city
- Scroll to zoom in/out
- Drag to rotate the view

## Performance Notes

The visualization is GPU-intensive. For optimal performance:
- Use a device with dedicated graphics
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Adjust the number of particles and effects if needed
